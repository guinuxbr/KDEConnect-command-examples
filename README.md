Here is my `KDEConnect-commands` that allows to control your Plasma Desktop from your Android phone. It uses [KDEConnect](https://community.kde.org/KDEConnect) that is capable to do some really cool stuff. In fact, you can do almost anything like send files from and to phone, control slideshow presentation, control multimedia application, remote input and the ability to run commands directly in your Linux box.

This repository contains a list of commands to be used in KDE Connect.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
To use it, you have to install KDE Connect package on your Linux distribution and the app in your Android phone.

The Android app can be found at [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kde.kdeconnect_tp) and [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.kde.kdeconnect_tp/).

You should have kde-connect package installed on your Linux system. In this example, I use Arch Linux.

```bash
sudo pacman -S kdeconnect
```

The package have some optional dependencies (in Arch Linux) that you should install to be able to use the respective feature in KDE Connect.

- **sshfs**: remote filesystem browser
- **kde-cli-tools**: configuration UI
- **qt5-declarative**: QML bindings
- **python-nautilus**: Nautilus integration
